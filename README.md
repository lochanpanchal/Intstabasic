## Project Summary
###The basic functionality implemented includes user authentication, sign in, sign up, updating user details, saving a post, and retrieving a post. However, this implementation is simplified and lacks error handling, validation, password hashing, and other security measures. It's important to enhance the implementation based on specific requirements and best practices.
